# CyberGuard: Empowering Cybersecurity with Advanced Behaviour Analysis by Sandboxing.
The purpose of CyberGuard is to analyze suspicious files, domains, IPs, and URLs to detect malware and other breaches, and automatically share them with the security community.

Scope of the project is :
1. Behaviour Analysis - this offers customizable settings for users to define and adjust behavioral analysis parameters.
2. Sandboxing Integration - to analyze suspicious files and activities in a controlled environment.
3. Real-Time Monitoring - Enable real-time monitoring of network activities and behaviors.

Collaboration: 
Include features for sharing threat intelligence, insights, and best practices facilitated among users. This includes:
1. Implementation of SIEMs - employs security information and event management systems (SIEMs) to monitor, collect, analyze, and report on system events.
2. Splunk and Splunk Storm - provides advanced analytics, real-time monitoring, and alerting capabilities, allowing it to identify and address potential threats.
3. TAXII & STIX -  The platform uses TAXII to facilitate secure data exchange between organizations, and STIX to represent structured cyber threat intelligence.
4. API Integration -  leverages API integration to seamlessly integrate its services with third-party tools and platforms. This integration enables enhanced data sharing, faster incident response, and more effective threat detection and prevention.

Adaptability of the CyberGuard :
crucial to effectively respond to the evolving threat landscape and the changing needs of users.
Key considerations - 1. Modular architecture
2. Open API Framework
3. Automated Threat Intelligence updates

The outcomes of the project CyberGuard are as follows :
1. Threat Detection
2. Behavioral Analysis Accuracy
3. Incident Response Efficiency
4. User-friendly Interface
5. Effective Sandbox Analysis
